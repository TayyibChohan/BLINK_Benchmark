The image breaks down the subject into geometric planes with sharp angles, creating a sense of dynamism and movement. The limited color palette of browns, reds and whites also contributes to the modernist, avant-garde feel.\n\nThe second image is a loose, gestural sketch rendered in black ink or charcoal. While it also reduces the forms to simplified shapes, the style is more about quick, expressive linework rather than the constructed, faceted planes seen in the first image.\n\nHowever, the third painting shares several key characteristics with the reference image. It employs a similar splintering and fracturing of the pictorial space into abstracted, geometric segments. The boats and their reflections are depicted through angled shapes and planes that break up and reshape the forms, much like the treatment of the figure in the first painting. The third image also makes use of a muted, limited color palette that is tonally similar to the browns and reds of the reference.\n\nSo in summary, while all three images utilize abstraction and simplification of forms to varying degrees, the third painting (B) most closely emulates the distinctive cubist-inspired style and fragmented visual language of the first reference image.
