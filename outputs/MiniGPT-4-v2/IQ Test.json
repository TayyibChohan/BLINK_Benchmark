This indicates a regular progression or rule in the sequence of images.\nAdditionally, each image has a common feature of having a green background with a black circle in the center, and picture B maintains this feature while adding a new element of a white square in the top-right corner. This variation suggests a gradual change or progression in the sequence of images.\nTherefore, based on these observations, I choose (B) picture B as the correct answer.",
