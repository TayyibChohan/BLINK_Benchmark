We know that there are four red-circled points on the second image, labeled A, B, C, and D. We also know that the first image has a single point, which we will call P.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to identify which point on the second image corresponds to the point P in the first image. We can use the fact that the red circles on the second image are centered at the corresponding points on the first image to help us make this identification.\n\n\nLet's consider each of the options:\n\n\n(A) Point A: This point is not the corresponding point to P in the first image. The red circle centered at Point A does not overlap with the first image at all.\n\n\n(B) Point B: This point is also not the corresponding point to P in the first image. The red circle centered at Point B overlaps with the first image, but the point does not match P.\n\n(C) Point C: This point is the correct corresponding point to P in the first image. The red circle centered at Point C overlaps with the first image at the exact location of Point P.\n(D) Point D: This point is not the corresponding point to P in the first image.
