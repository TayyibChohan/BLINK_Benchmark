In the second image, those objects have moved out of frame to the left, while more of the brown box object is visible entering from the right side of the frame.\n\nThis rightward shift in perspective between the two frames indicates the camera is panning to the right, or clockwise, around the arranged objects as the video plays out.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: (B) right",

In Image 2, taken later in the video, the camera has moved to view the same objects more from the right side, with the rice bag now partially obscured behind the soy sauce.\n\nThis change in perspective between the two frames indicates the camera was panning to the right, in a clockwise motion, as the video was recorded.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) right - the camera is moving to the right when shooting this video of the shelf and products.",
