Since the image is a black and white drawing, it is essential to focus on the shapes and patterns of the carton and the options.\n\nFirst, observe the outer surface of the carton and identify its key features, such as the shape, size, and any distinct patterns. Then, look at the four picture options and compare them to the carton's features. The option that shares the most similarities with the carton's outer surface is the one that can be folded from it.\n\nIn this case, the correct answer is (B) picture B.",
